            <p>IF ALL goes well, the first major space mission of 2022 will be the launch of the Space Launch System
                rocket in February. After many budget and schedule overruns, NASA's colossal rocket is finally set for
                its first uncrewed flight, which will carry several small satellites into orbits either near or around
                the moon.</p> <br>
